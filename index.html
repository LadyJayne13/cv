  <h1>Farm Clan Cats</h1>
  <p>The Farm Clan was established about the year 2006. At its founding were two black and white cats. They were brothers, and both of them had cut off tails. One was named Stub, and the other was named Bob. Time would soon tell that Bob was not Stub's brother. After a few months from the founding of the Farm Clan, Bob had kittens.</p>
  <p>The Farm Clan continued to grow, and at times, sadly decreased in numbers as some of the members of the clan died, or set out on their own adventures.</p>
