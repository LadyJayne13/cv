    <p>Shasta is one of Jynx's kittens from the second litter. She was one of the larger kittens. Shasta had gone away to live with another family. For unknown reasons, the arrangement did not work out. The humans were able to trap Shasta and return her to the farm.</p>
    <p>Shasta is very talkative. She has a distinct meow. She calls for her humans to pet her head, but walks away before they have a chance to pet her. All the while she is talking to them and demanding that they pet her.</p>
